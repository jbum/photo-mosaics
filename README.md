Photo Mosaics

Code for creating photo-mosaics from Flickr thumbnails.  Based on the code I originally pushed with the book, Flickr Hacks.

I originally wrote this code in Perl using the ImageMagick/PerlMagick library.  Incomplete, but working ports to Ruby/RMagick and Python/PIL are also provided.

Sample images created with this code can be seen in my [Flickr photo collection](https://www.flickr.com/photos/krazydad/sets/874417/).

All of these scripts require a Flickr API Key in order to retrieve images from Flickr.
